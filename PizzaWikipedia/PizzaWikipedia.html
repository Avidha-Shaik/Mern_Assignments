    <p>The origin of the word Pizza is uncertain. The food was invented in <a href="//"> Naples</a> about 200 years ago.
        It is the name for a special type of <a href="https://">flatbread</a>, made with special <a href="//">dough</a>.
        The pizza enjoyed a second birth as it was taken to the <a href="https://">United States</a> in the late 19th
        century.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatbread">Flatbreads</a>, like the <a href="//">focaccia</a> from <a
            href="//">Liguria</a>, have been known for a very long time. Pizzas need to be baked at temperatures of
        200–250 °C. Hardly any <a href="//">household oven</a> could reach such temperatures at the time. Because of
        this, the pizza was made at home, and then given to the town bakery to bake. In June 1889, the Neapolitan chef
        <a href="//">Raffaele Esposito</a> created the "<a href="//">Margherita</a>" in honour of <a href="//">Queen
            Margherita</a>, and was the first pizza to include <a href="//"></a>cheese</a>.</p>

    <p>Pizza was brought to the <a href="//"></a>United States</a> with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth
        century;[4] and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants concentrated. The country's first pizzeria
        (place that focuses in pizza), <a href="//">Lombardi's</a>, opened in 1905.[5] Veterans returning from <a
            href="https://">World War II</a>'s Italian Campaign were a ready market for pizza.[6] Since then, pizza <a
            href="https://">consumption</a> has increased in the <a href="https://">U.S.</a> Pizza chains such as <a
            href="https://">Domino's</a>, <a href="https://">Pizza Hut</a>, and <a href="https://">Papa John's</a>, have
        outlets all over the nation. Thirteen percent of the <a href="https://">U.S. population</a> eats pizza on any
        given day.</p>

    <p>In the 20th century, pizza has become an international food. The toppings may be quite different depending on the
        local tastes. These pizzas consist of the same basic design. They also include many types of ingredients such as
        <a href="https://">anchovies</a>, <a href="https://">egg</a>, <a href="https://">pineapple</a>,<a
            href="https://">banana</a> ,<a href="https://">coconut</a> , <a href="https://">sauerkraut</a>, <a
            href="https://">eggplant</a>, <a href="https://">kimchi</a>, <a href="https://">lamb</a>, <a
            href="https://">couscous</a>, <a href="https://">chicken</a>, <a href="https://">fish</a>, and <a
            href="https://">hellfish</a>s. Sometimes, meats prepared in styles such as <a href="https://">Greek
            lamb</a>, <a href="https://">Gyros</a> or <a href="https://">chicken tikka masala</a>, and non-traditional
        spices such as <a href="https://">curry</a> and <a href="https://">Thai sweet chili</a> are added too. Pizzas
        can also be made without meat for <a href="https://">vegetarians</a>, and without <a href="https://">cheese</a>,
        for <a href="https://">vegans</a>.</p>
