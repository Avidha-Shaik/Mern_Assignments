    <p>The origin of the word Pizza is uncertain. The food was invented in <a href="//"> Naples</a> about 200 years ago.
        It is the name for a special type of <a href="https://">flatbread</a>, made with special <a href="//">dough</a>.
        The pizza enjoyed a second birth as it was taken to the <a href="https://">United States</a> in the late 19th
        century.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatbread">Flatbreads</a>, like the <a href="//">focaccia</a> from <a
            href="//">Liguria</a>, have been known for a very long time. Pizzas need to be baked at temperatures of
        200–250 °C. Hardly any <a href="//">household oven</a> could reach such temperatures at the time. Because of
        this, the pizza was made at home, and then given to the town bakery to bake. In June 1889, the Neapolitan chef
        <a href="//">Raffaele Esposito</a> created the "<a href="//">Margherita</a>" in honour of <a href="//">Queen
            Margherita</a>, and was the first pizza to include <a href="//"></a>cheese</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Pizza was brought to the <a href="//"></a>United States</a> with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth
        century;[4] and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants concentrated. The country's first pizzeria
        (place that focuses in pizza), <a href="//">Lombardi's</a>, opened in 1905.[5] Veterans returning from <a
            href="https://">World War II</a>'s Italian Campaign were a ready market for pizza.[6] Since then, pizza <a
            href="https://">consumption</a> has increased in the <a href="https://">U.S.</a> Pizza chains such as <a
            href="https://">Domino's</a>, <a href="https://">Pizza Hut</a>, and <a href="https://">Papa John's</a>, have
        outlets all over the nation. Thirteen percent of the <a href="https://">U.S. population</a> eats pizza on any
        given day.</p>

    <p>In the 20th century, pizza has become an international food. The toppings may be quite different depending on the
        local tastes. These pizzas consist of the same basic design. They also include many types of ingredients such as
        <a href="https://">anchovies</a>, <a href="https://">egg</a>, <a href="https://">pineapple</a>,<a
            href="https://">banana</a> ,<a href="https://">coconut</a> , <a href="https://">sauerkraut</a>, <a

            href="https://">hellfish</a>s. Sometimes, meats prepared in styles such as <a href="https://">Greek
            lamb</a>, <a href="https://">Gyros</a> or <a href="https://">chicken tikka masala</a>, and non-traditional
        spices such as <a href="https://">curry</a> and <a href="https://">Thai sweet chili</a> are added too. Pizzas
        can also be made without meat for <a href="https://">vegetarians</a>, and without <a href="https://">cheese</a>,
        for <a href="https://">vegans</a>.

    <p><a href="#">Neapolitan pizza</a> ( <b><i>pizza Napoletana</i></b> ). Authentic Neapolitan pizzas are made with local ingredients like <a href="#">San Marzano tomatoes</a>, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of <a href="#">Mount Vesuvius</a> and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, made with the milk from <a href="#">water buffalo</a> raised in the marshlands of <a href="#">Campania</a> and Lazio in a semi-wild state (this mozzarella is protected by its own European law).
    </p>
      <p>  The genuine Neapolitan pizza dough consists of Italian flour, natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer's yeast, salt and water.The dough must be kneaded by hand or with a low-speed mixer. After the rising process, the dough must be formed by hand without the help of a rolling pin or other mechanical device, and may be no more than 3 mm (1/8 in) thick.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pizza is cooked in an oven. When cooked, it should be crispy, tender and fragrant. Neapolitan pizza has gained the status of "guaranteed traditional specialty" in Italy. This admits only three official variants: <b>Pizza marinara</b> , which is made with tomato, garlic, oregano and extra virgin olive oil (although most Neapolitan pizzerias also add basil to the marinara), Pizza Margherita, made with tomato, mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil, and Pizza Margherita DOC made with tomato, buffalo mozzarella from Campania in fillets, basil and extra virgin olive oil.
    </p>
    <p> 
        <b>Lazio style</b>: Pizza in Lazio (Rome), as well as in many other parts of Italy is available in 2 different "flavors": 1) In take-away shops so-called "Pizza Rustica" or "Pizza a Taglio". Pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick (1–2 cm). The crust similar to that of an English muffin and mostly cooked in an electric oven. When purchased, it is usually cut with scissors or knife and priced by weight. 2) In Pizza Restaurants (Pizzerias) it is served in a dish in its traditional round shape.</p>
    </p>
    
    <p>Other types of Lazio-style pizza include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pizza Romana</b> (in Naples): tomato, mozzarella, anchovies, oregano, oil;</li>
        <li><b>Pizza Viennese</b>: tomato, mozzarella, German sausage, oregano, oil;</li>
        <li><b>Pizza Capricciosa</b> ("Capricious Pizza"): mozzarella, tomato, mushrooms, artichokes, cooked ham, olives, and oil.</li>
    <li><b>Pizza Quattro Stagioni </b>("Four Seasons Pizza"): same ingredients for the Capricciosa, but ingredients are not mix</li>
  <li><b>Pizza Quattro Formaggi</b> ("Four Cheese Pizza"): tomatoes, mozzarella, stracchino, fontina, gorgonzola.</li>  
    </ul>
    <p><b>Sicilian-style</b> pizza has its toppings baked directly into the crust.</p>
    <p><b>White pizza</b> (pizza bianca) uses no tomato sauce, often substituting pesto or dairy products such as sour cream. Most commonly, especially on the East Coast of the United States, the toppings consist only of mozzarella and ricotta cheese drizzled with olive oil and basil and garlic. In Rome, the term pizza bianca refers to a type of bread topped only with olive oil. Some white pizzas use Alfredo sauce as the pizza sauce for a better flavor.</p>
